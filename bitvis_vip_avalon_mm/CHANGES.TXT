Released: 2020-03-30
- Replaced use_provided_msg_id_panel and msg_id_panel for parent_msg_id_panel in
  vvc_cmd_pkg. Added parent_msg_id_panel optional parameter to all VVC procedures
  for future HVVC support.

v2.5.1
----------
Released: 2020-02-16
- Fixed wrong order of parameters in wait_on_bfm_exit call.

v2.5.0
----------
Released: 2020-01-24
- Added bfm_sync to the BFM configuration record.
- Added new BFM synchronisation methods with default SYNC_ON_CLOCK_ONLY.
  The BFM will synchronise and start with falling edge, detect clock period, and
  exit after a quarter clock period.
- BFM config defaults setup_time, hold_time and clock_period are now 
  default -1 ns, i.e. will require user configuration if BFM synchronisation is
  used with other than SYNC_ON_CLOCK_ONLY.
- VVC command insert_delay() will raise a TB_ERROR when called if the 
  bfm_config.clock_period has not been set.  
- Direct Transaction Transfer (DTT) is divided in a global trigger signal and 
  shared variable with transfer related information.
