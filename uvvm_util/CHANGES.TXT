- First version. Hence no change history for the UVVM Utility Library.
  This library is a continuation and expansion of the Bitvis Utility Library.
  The Bitvis Utility Library is discontinued as of version 2.6.0 (except for bug fixes).
  See the Bitvis Utility Library v2.6.0 for full change history prior to the release of
  UVVM.
  -Important changes since release of the Bitvis Utility Library v2.6.0:
    - Removed support for VHDL93 and VHDL2002
    - Included support for hierarchical alert reporting. Hierarchical alert reporting
      allows for a hierarchy tree to be defined during run-time. The alert summary will
      then be shown as a tree of defined scopes. Alert counters will propagate up the tree
      to the top level, and stop limits can be set at each level in the hierarchy.
      See the PowerPoint presentation 'UVVM_Utility_Library_Concepts_and_Usage.pps' for
      more information.
