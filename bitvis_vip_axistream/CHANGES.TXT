----------
Released: 2017-03-16
- Updated documentation
- Added support for TDEST, TID, TSTRB.
  - Required changes by user :
    - When declaring the axistream interface signal, these new signals must be contrained, for example:

        signal axistream_if_m : t_axistream_if(tdata(GC_DATA_WIDTH -1 downto 0),
                                               tkeep((GC_DATA_WIDTH/8)-1 downto 0),
                                               tuser(GC_USER_WIDTH -1 downto 0),
                                               tstrb(GC_STRB_WIDTH-1 downto 0),   -- new!
                                               tid  (GC_TID_WIDTH-1 downto 0),    -- new!
                                               tdest(C_TDEST_WIDTH-1 downto 0)    -- new!
                                              );

    - Calls to init_axistream_if_signals() must be updated, if any.


v2.0.3
----------
Released: 2017-02-13
- Applied minor bugfixes and updated documentation for v2.0.x


v2.0.2
----------
Released: 2017-02-01
- Applied minor bugfixes after beta testing


v2.0.1
----------
Released: 2017-01-27

- Changed order of BFM-check methods. "alert_level" moved to first optional parameter.
- Changed ID_BFM to ID_INSERTED_DELAY in INSERT_DELAY method
- Added AWAIT_ANY_COMPLETION.
- Due to updates in store_result and fetch_result() in uvvm_vvc_framework:
-  - added definition of t_vvc_result, t_vvc_result_queue_element, t_vvc_response, shared_vvc_response
-  - updated call to store_result()
- Removed the use of INSERT_DELAY_IN_TIME. Merged with INSERT_DELAY.
- Bugfix in AxiStream BFM : The transmit procedure did not sample tready at the rising edge of clock.
