Common VVC Methods
**********************************************************************************************************************************
* All VVC procedures are defined in td_vvc_framework_common_methods_pkg.vhd and ti_vvc_framework_support_pkg.vhd
* All parameters in brackets are optional.

await_completion()
==================================================================================================================================
Tells the VVC to await the completion of either all pending commands or a specified command index. A message will be logged before 
and at the end of the wait. The procedure will report an alert if not all commands have completed within the specified timeout. 
The severity of this alert will be TB_ERROR. It is also possible to broadcast by setting vvc_select to ALL_VVCS (:ref:`t_vvc_select`)
or to multicast using ALL_CHANNELS/ALL_INSTANCES (:ref:`multicast <vvc_framework_broadcasting>`.). 

To await the completion of one out of several VVCs in a group use the overload with the vvc_list. The vvc_list of type 
:ref:`t_prot_vvc_list` (protected type) is a local variable that needs to be declared in the sequencer. This overload will block 
the sequencer while waiting, but not the VVCs, so they can continue to receive commands from other sequencers.

.. important::

    * To use the vvc_list, the package ``uvvm_vvc_framework.ti_protected_types_pkg.all`` must be included in the testbench.
    * The command with the vvc_list requires VVCs supporting the VVC activity register introduced in UVVM release v2020.05.19.
    * Combining old VVCs not supporting VVC activity regiser and new VVCs is not supported by await_completion().

add_to_vvc_list()
==================================================================================================================================
Adds the VVC to a :ref:`t_prot_vvc_list`. The protected VVC list can be used with ``await_completion()`` to block the sequencer 
while waiting for the completion of VVC commands. The vvc_list can be cleared using the ``clear_list(VOID)`` method.

fetch_result()
==================================================================================================================================
Fetches a stored result using the command index. A result is stored when using e.g. the read or receive commands in a VVC. The 
fetched result is available on the *result* output. The Boolean output *fetch_is_accepted* is used to indicate if the fetch was 
successful or not. A fetch can fail if e.g. the wanted_idx did not have a result to store, or the wanted_idx read has not yet been 
executed. Omitting the *fetch_is_accepted* parameter causes the parameters to be checked automatically in the procedure. On 
successful fetch, a message with log ID ID_UVVM_CMD_RESULT is logged. ::

.. _vvc_framework_broadcasting:

Broadcasting and Multicasting
==================================================================================================================================
Commands in UVVM can be distributed to all instances of a VVC or to all VVCs using dedicated parameters.

VVC_BROADCAST
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The VVC_BROADCAST command parameter can be used when a command is to target all VVCs within the test environment, reducing the 
number of command instructions needed in the testbench. ::

    -- Examples:
    enable_log_msg(VVC_BROADCAST, ALL_MESSAGES); -- enable logging for all VVCs
    await_completion(VVC_BROADCAST, 10 us); -- wait for all VVCs to complete


ALL_INSTANCES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ALL_INSTANCES command parameter can be used when a command is targeting all instances of a VVC within the test environment, 
reducing the number of command instructions needed in the testbench. ::

    -- Examples:
    enable_log_msg(SBI_VVCT, ALL_INSTANCES, ALL_MESSAGES); -- enable logging for all instances of SBI_VVCT
    await_completion(SBI_VVCT, ALL_INSTANCES, 100 ns); -- wait for all instances of SBI_VVCT to complete

ALL_CHANNELS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ALL_CHANNELS command parameter can be used when a command is targeting all channels of a VVC within the test environment, 
reducing the number of command instructions needed in the testbench. ::

    -- Examples:
    enable_log_msg(UART_VVCT, 1, ALL_CHANNELS, ALL_MESSAGES); -- enable logging for all channels of UART_VVCT instance 1
    await_completion(UART_VVCT, ALL_INSTANCES, ALL_CHANNELS, 100 ns); -- wait for all instances and channels of UART_VVCT to complete


C_VVCT_ALL_INSTANCES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See description above. C_VVCT_ALL_INSTANCES = ALL_INSTANCES.

.. warning::

    This command parameter might be removed in a future release and we encourage the use of ALL_INSTANCES.

.. _vvc_framework_essential_mechanisms:

**********************************************************************************************************************************
Essential Mechanisms
**********************************************************************************************************************************
This section explains some of the essential mechanisms necessary for running VVC Framework, in addition to helpful and important 
VVC status and configuration records which are accessible directly from the testbench.
More details on the VVC Framework and the command mechanism can be found in the 
`VVC Framework Manual <https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/tree/master/uvvm_vvc_framework/doc/VVC_Framework_Manual.pdf>`_.

Libraries
==================================================================================================================================
In order to use a VVC the following libraries need to be included: ::

    library uvvm_util;
    context uvvm_util.uvvm_util_context;

    library uvvm_vvc_framework;
    use uvvm_vvc_framework.ti_vvc_framework_support_pkg.all;

    library bitvis_vip_<name>;
    context bitvis_vip_<name>.vvc_context;

Types
==================================================================================================================================    
Some VVC-related types will need to be hierarchically declared, based on their package name, in order to avoid ambiguity among 
different VVCs.

If only a single VVC is needed: ::

    --Example:
    variable v_result : t_vvc_result;

If several VVCs are needed: ::

    --Example:
    variable v_spi_result : bitvis_vip_spi.vvc_cmd_pkg.t_vvc_result;
    variable v_axi_result : bitvis_vip_axi.vvc_cmd_pkg.t_vvc_result;

.. _t_vvc_result:

t_vvc_result
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The common type t_vvc_result is always defined with the max length of fetched data that the VVC supports (see the definition of 
t_vvc_result in its corresponding vvc_cmd_pkg). Therefore it is recommended to define the range of the desired data output after 
the fetch_result method has been completed. ::

    --Example:
    variable v_data     : t_vvc_result;
    variable v_data_out : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);

And then: ::

    fetch_result(SPI_VVCT, 1, v_cmd_idx, v_data, "Fetching result of SPI receive operation");
    v_data_out := v_data(7 downto 0);


UVVM Initialization
==================================================================================================================================
The following mechanisms are required for running UVVM VVC Framework:

ti_uvvm_engine
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This entity contains a process that will initialize the UVVM environment, and has to be instantiated in the testbench harness, or 
alternatively in the top-level testbench. ::

    -- Example:
    i_ti_uvvm_engine : entity uvvm_vvc_framework.ti_uvvm_engine;

await_uvvm_initialization()
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This procedure is a blocking procedure that has to be called from the testbench sequencer, prior to any VVC calls, to ensure that 
the UVVM engine has been initialized and is ready. This procedure will check the shared_uvvm_state on each delta cycle until the 
UVVM engine has been initialized. Note that this method is depending on the ti_uvvm_engine mechanism. ::

    -- Example:
    await_uvvm_initialization(VOID);

UVVM and VVC User Accessible Shared Variables and Global Signals
==================================================================================================================================
UVVM and VVC shared variables and global signals are defined in global_signals_and_shared_variables_pkg.vhd and the various VVC 
packages.

shared_uvvm_status

VVC Status, Configuration and Transaction Information
==================================================================================================================================
The VVC status, configuration and transaction information records are defined in each individual VVC methods package.

Each VVC instance and channel can be configured and useful information can be accessed from the testbench via dedicated shared 
variables.

From the VVC configuration shared variable, one is given the ability to tailor each VVC to one's needs, in addition to access the 
BFM configuration record via the bfm_config identifier. In addition to BFM configuration possibility, the configuration settings 
consist of command and result queue settings, BFM access separation delay and a VVC dedicated message ID panel. Note that some 
BFMs require user configuration, e.g. the bit_time setting in serial interface BFMs.

The VVC status shared variable provide access to the command status parameters for each of the VVCs, such as the current and 
previous command index, and the number of pending commands in the VVCs command queue. This provide a helpful tool, e.g. when 
synchronizing VVCs in the test sequencer using the await_completion() or await_any_completion() methods.

When using a wave viewer during simulation, the transaction shared variable provides helpful information regarding current VVC 
operation and transaction information such as address and data. Note that the accessible fields depend on the VVC and its 
implementation. An example of two SBI VVCs performing FIFO write operations, followed by check operations, is shown in Figure 1.

.. _vvc_framework_activity_watchdog:

Activity Watchdog
==================================================================================================================================
UVVM VVC Framework has an activity watchdog mechanism which all Bitvis VVCs support. All VVCs can be automatically registered in a 
centralized VVC activity register at start-up and will, during simulation, update the VVC activity register with their current 
activity status, i.e. ACTIVE or INACTIVE, which again is monitored by the activity watchdog. A timeout counter in the activity 
watchdog will start after the last update has occurred in the VVC activity register, and the timeout counter is reset on any VVC 
activity. An alert will be raised if none of the VVCs have an activity prior to the timeout counter reaching the specified timeout 
value. Note that the activity watchdog will continue to monitor VVC activity, even after a timeout, until alert stop limit is 
reached.

The activity watchdog has to be included as a concurrent procedure parallel to the testbench sequencer or in the test harness in 
order to be activated. Note that the activity watchdog will raise a TB_WARNING if the number of expected VVCs does not match the 
number of registered VVCs in the VVC activity register, and that leaf VVCs (e.g. channels such as UART RX and TX) are counted 
individually. This checking can be disabled by setting the number of expected VVCs to 0. Also note that the total number of VVCs 
registered in the VVC activity register cannot exceed the C_MAX_TB_VVC_NUM count, default set to 20 in the adaptations_pkg.vhd, 
and this will result in a TB_ERROR raised by the VVC activity register.

Note that some VVCs should not be monitored by the activity watchdog. This currently applies to the clock generator VVC, as this 
VVC may continue to be active even after all other testbench activity has stopped. This VVC will have to be included in the number 
of expected VVCs registered in the VVC activity register but will not have any effect on the activity watchdog timeout counter.

Distribution of Transaction Info - From VVCs and/or Monitors
==================================================================================================================================
UVVM supports sharing transaction information in a controlled manner within the complete testbench environment. This allows VVCs 
and Monitors to provide transaction info to any other part of your testbench – using a predefined structured mechanism. This makes 
it even easier to make good VHDL testbenches.

Transaction information may be used in many different ways, but the main purpose is to share information inside the testbench of 
activity or accesses on a given DUT interface. Such information could typically be provided from a dedicated interface Monitor, 
but making such a dedicated Monitor is sometimes quite time consuming and often not really needed. For that reason, UVVM provides 
a mechanism for getting the transaction information directly from the VVC.

.. _vvc_framework_transaction_info_purpose:

Purpose
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By enabling the distribution of transaction info, models or any other parts of the testbench can see exactly what accesses have 
been made on the various interfaces of the DUT, so that the expected DUT behaviour and outputs may be checked. Let us illustrate 
this with a really simple testbench scenario to verify a UART peripheral with an AXI-lite register/CPU interface on one side and 
the UART RX and TX ports on the other side. The test sequencer may command the AXI-lite BFM or VVC to write a data byte into the 
UART TX register, and then it must be checked that the data byte is transmitted out on the DUT TX output some time later.

    a. A simple testbench approach could be to have the test sequencer also telling the receiving UART BFM or VVC exactly what to 
       expect. This is a straightforward approach, but requires more action and data control inside the test sequencer. This could 
       of course all be handled in a super-procedure, but for any undetermined behaviour inside the BFM or VVC, like random data 
       generation or error injection, that would not work. See Figure 2.
    b. A more advanced approach is to have a model overlooking the DUT accesses, generate the expected data and tell the receiving 
       BFM or VVC to check for that data. See Figure 3.
    c. An even more advanced approach would be to use a Scoreboard to check received data (from DUT via VVC) against expected data 
       from a model. See Figure 4.

However, for the two latter approaches the model needs information about exactly what happened (the transaction) on the various 
DUT interfaces, so that it can generate the correct expected data. For the model it doesn’t matter if the transaction info comes 
from a Monitor or from a VVC, as long as the information is correct.

The model could of course look at the interfaces and analyse the actual transactions, but distributing this task to the VVC or 
Monitor makes the testbench far more structured and significantly improves overview, maintenance, extensibility and reuse – at 
least for anything above medium simple verification challenges.

Another purpose of providing transaction information is for progress viewing and debugging – typically via the wave view or 
simulation transcripts.

Transaction definitions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By transactions we normally talk about a complete end to end transfer of data across an interface. This could be anything from a 
simple write, read or transfer of a single word - to a complete packet in a packet-oriented protocol like Ethernet. The word 
transaction is however also used for both sub-sets and super-sets of this – depending on the protocol and even on how we want to 
control our system or testbench. In order to communicate properly and to assure that transactions are properly understood, the 
following terms are defined:

    * **Base transaction (BT)** is the lowest level of a complete transaction as allowed from the central sequencer. E.g. 
      AXI-lite, UART, Ethernet and AXI-Stream transactions.
    * **Sub-transaction (ST)** is the lowest level of an incomplete transaction as allowed from a BFM. The sub-transaction as such 
      is complete seen from a handshake point of view, but the transfer of data is not complete. A split transaction protocol will 
      typically have sub-transactions. E.g. Avalon Read Request and Avalon Read Response.
    * **Leaf transaction (LT)** is not a transaction type in itself, but is the lowest level of complete or incomplete transaction 
      defined for a given protocol. I.e. a sub-transaction when this is defined for a given protocol, otherwise a base transaction. 
      This definition is needed in order simplify various explanations. E.g. for Avalon: LT = the sub transactions, and for UART, 
      SBI or Ethernet: LT = the base transactions (as no sub-transaction exist for these protocols)
    * **Compound transaction (CT)** is a set of transactions or other methods or statements that as a total is doing a more 
      complex operation. A compound transaction involves calling multiple base transactions. E.g. sbi_poll_until() or a UART 
      transmit of N consecutive bytes. No compound transaction needs to be defined.

Transaction information
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information about the above transactions is typically provided to a model in the test harness. Depending on whether the 
transaction info is provided from the VVC or Monitor, different types of information will be available. Common for both is that 
they always provide info about the operation (read, write, transmit, etc.) and often also any other protocol specific info. For a 
UART this could be data and parity, for an SBI it could be address and data, and for Ethernet, the packet fields.

This minimum is normally what the Monitor can provide from just analysing the interface, and this is also normally enough for a 
model to generate expected DUT outputs. The VVC on the other hand, can provide more info, which could be useful for instance for 
progress viewing and debugging.

The transaction information is organised as a transaction record with some predefined fields as shown below. Table 1 shows the 
general transaction record, whereas table 2 shows a concrete example for the SBI.

Note that for a given interface/protocol, the VVC and the Monitor will use the same interface dedicated transaction record type - 
with some fields potentially unused.

Other interfaces will of course have different protocol dedicated fields, or even a complete protocol dedicated sub-record (e.g. 
for Ethernet packet fields).

Transaction Info transfer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to reduce the number of signals from a VVC or Monitor, all possible simultaneous transactions (and their transaction 
records) are collected into a single transaction group record. For an SBI interface, this will consist of a BT record and 
potentially a CT record. Whereas for an Avalon, it will in addition also consist of two ST records, because for instance a read 
request may be active at the same time as a read response. (And the sub-transactions are part of a base transaction and may also 
be part of a CT).

Table 3 shows the maximum transaction group record for an SBI, whereas Table 4 shows the maximum transaction group record for an 
Avalon MM. The bold CT is optional for both, and thus depends on whether CTs have been defined in the VVC. Multiple parallel STs 
may be written to the transaction group record simultaneously - as these are handled by different "threads" (concurrent statements 
like a process).

A Monitor cannot know about CTs, and thus a Monitor will never fill in that sub-record. A Monitor for a split transaction protocol 
(i.e. with multiple STs) may or may not provide BT info. If it does, this should normally be implemented in a higher level 
"wrapper".

.. note::

    * A VVC will update its Transaction Info leaf transaction details at the start of the transaction when the BFM is called, then
      again when the transaction is completed, and turned off one delta cycle afterwards.
    * A Monitor will set its Transaction Info record after the transaction is finished (or transaction status is known) and keep 
      it on for a pre-defined time - or until the next transaction is finished if earlier.

.. hint::

    * For operations in which the VVC/Monitor knows the data beforehand, e.g. WRITE, TRANSMIT, it is recommended that the model
      triggers on the VVC/Monitor trigger signal and checks when the transaction_status is 'IN_PROGRESS' and then samples the 
      transaction value.
    * Whereas for operations in which the VVC/Monitor receives the data after the transaction, e.g. READ, RECEIVE, it is 
      recommended that the model triggers on the VVC/Monitor trigger signal and checks when the transaction_status is 'COMPLETED' 
      and then samples the transaction value.

Transaction Info record signals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Transaction Info record is provided out of the VVC and Monitor using sets of a global signal and a shared variable. These and 
all Transaction Info related VHDL types are defined in transaction_pkg.vhd, located in the VIP src folder (except for the 
t_transaction_status type, which is defined in types_pkg).

    * **Monitor trigger signal** : *global_<protocol-name>_monitor_transaction_trigger*, e.g. global_uart_monitor_transaction_trigger
    * **Monitor shared variable** : *shared_<protocol-name>_monitor_transaction_info*, e.g. shared_uart_monitor_transaction_info
    * **VVC trigger signal**: *global_<protocol-name>_vvc_transaction_trigger*, e.g. global_uart_vvc_transaction_trigger.
    * **VVC shared variable** : *shared_<protocol-name>_vvc_transaction_info*, e.g, shared_uart_vvc_transaction_info. The VVC is 
      also responsible for filling out the vvc_meta record field.

Transaction Info signal and shared variable
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A VVC or Monitor will trigger the global trigger signals listed in :ref:`vvc_framework_transaction_info_record` when information 
of a new transaction info is made available. For a VVC, the transaction info can be available prior to the corresponding bus 
access, i.e. before calling the BFM method, or at the end of the access, i.e. when the BFM method has finished. The global trigger 
signal will be pulsed in both cases for a delta cycle. The VVC will set the transaction info back to default values immediately 
after the second trigger, but then without pulsing the global trigger signal.

For a Monitor, the transaction info will be made available immediately after a bus access is completed and then the global trigger 
signal will be pulsed for a delta cycle. The transaction info is valid when the global trigger signal is pulsed and it is set back 
to default values after a period of transaction_display_time, set in the Monitor configuration record, or when a new transaction is 
started.

Examples of Transaction Info Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All important information regarding a transfer is available in the transaction info and accessible in the test environment, and 
depending on one's needs there are some recommended approaches for how to utilize the transaction info:

    #. For complex protocols, where several combinations of data widths and others are possible, it can be complicated for a VVC 
       to determine the structure and constraints of the scoreboard element. Examples of VVCs with such complex protocols are the 
       AXI Stream and the Avalon ST VVCs. Setting up the Scoreboard and checking of received data against expected data for such 
       complex protocols has to be done in the test harness, where the generic scoreboard is instantiated with a constrained 
       scoreboard element and where a dedicated process monitors the VVC transaction info and checks received data with the 
       scoreboard.
    #. Transaction info can be used in a DUT Model process that monitors and decodes the actual transaction info data in the test 
       harness. The DUT Model will use the decoded transaction info and add expected data to the VVC scoreboard on the DUT 
       receiving side, e.g. to the SBI_VVC_SB while a SBI VVC is responsible for performing the DUT read access and check received 
       data with SBI_VVC_SB. See :ref:`Transaction Info Purpose <vvc_framework_transaction_info_purpose>`, example C, for how a 
       DUT Model will appear in the test harness.

.. _vvc_framework_transaction_info_mechanism:

Mechanism
^^^^^^^^^
The technique of using transaction info in the test environment, either in a VVC scoreboard support process or in a DUT Model, 
involves the following 3 steps:

    #. Wait for the interface trigger signal to be set.
    #. Decode the base transaction info operation.
    #. Execute wanted operation from the obtained transaction info.

A simple VVC Scoreboard Support process is presented in Figure 5, demonstrating how VVC scoreboard actions can be accomplished 
using transaction info and a stand-alone process when not performed by a VVC. The same approach is shown in Figure 6 with a simple 
DUT Model process, demonstrating how DUT modelling can be accomplished using transaction info and a stand-alone process. Note that 
Figure 5 uses aliasing to simplify and improve code readability, while Figure 6 uses full transaction info names.

these scoreboard approaches are already performed by the VVCs.

Figure 7 demonstrates the setup of a VVC Scoreboard Support process that operates with the 3 steps listed in 
:ref:`Transaction Info Mechanism <vvc_framework_transaction_info_mechanism>`. For complex scoreboard elements, such as records, the 
scoreboard package declaration, defining the shared variable and scoreboard approaches have to be performed outside the VVC.

VVC Local Sequencers
==================================================================================================================================
UVVM testbenches may have one or more central sequencers – also known as test sequencers or test drivers. A single test sequencer 
is recommended in order to reduce complexity – as synchronization between multiple parallel test sequencer could be really complex.
UVVM does however also provide support for so called local sequencers. These sequencers will typically run inside the VVCs 
executor process. The executor will typically run a single transaction via a BFM procedure towards the DUT interface, like an 
sbi_write() or uart_expect() procedure. For more advanced VVCs it would however make sense to send even higher level commands to a 
VVC, like requesting it to transmit N random bytes, or setting up a peripheral by writing to multiple configuration registers. In 
these cases, a single command to the VVC will trigger a complete sequence of accesses towards the DUT. The code inside the VVC 
executors handling these sequences are called local sequencers as they are local to the VVC and thus also improves re-use. These 
sequences of transactions may also be defined as Compound Transactions (see :ref:`vvc_framework_transaction_info_definitions`).

An example of a local sequencer is the randomization sequences in the UART VVC, and poll_until in the SBI VVC.

Local sequencer requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following requirements should be followed when making local sequencers (basically any VVC command resulting in more than one 
base transaction):

    #. If Transaction Info is supported, then both the leaf transaction and the compound transaction info should be updated (the 
       latter is not required).
    #. The sequence should be handled directly inside the VVC executor - and not inside the BFM (otherwise updating the leaf 
       transactions for Transaction Info could be difficult).
    #. It should be possible to terminate the sequence immediately after each leaf (or base) transaction - on request from the 
       central sequencer issuing a terminate_current_command() or terminate_all_commands().

Protocol Aware Error Injection
==================================================================================================================================
Error injection into the DUT could be very useful in a testbench in order to test how the DUT handles interface errors when these 
errors are: a) to be detected and corrected, b) detected only, and c) not detected but may or may not affect the behaviour.

Protocol aware error injection is defined here as intelligent error injection, given knowledge about the interface and protocol, 
e.g. to inject a parity error in a protocol rather than just inverting or delaying a signal without pre-defined detailed support 
to do this at the right place. The latter is supported by a dedicated "brute force" error injection VIP 'bitvis_vip_error_injection' 
in UVVM.

UVVM has a pre-defined methodology for handling protocol aware error injection in a structured way.

.. note::

    Only some VVCs and BFMs currently support error injection. The principles shown for these VVCs and BFMs may be applied 
    directly also for user defined VIP.

UVVM error injection principles
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error injection may be applied randomly, with no limitations. For UVVM however, we recommend the following approach:

    #. No randomization of behaviour inside BFMs when this could affect the DUT behaviour or output (and a monitor would be 
       required to check the actual DUT stimuli). Hence BFM procedures should only be called with parameters explicitly defining 
       the interface behaviour (from the BFM side). Thus no parity error randomization inside. The only exception is for behaviour 
       that should not affect the DUT. Thus the position of a data bit error could be randomized inside the BFM.
    #. It is recommended that more advanced VVCs include randomization - in order to distribute this away from the test sequencer 
       and increase the re-use value of a VVC. Thus a VVC may be told to apply say 10% parity errors for a UART_VVC transmission 
       into the DUT. In that case the VVC will randomly - with a 10% probability - inject a parity error into the DUT. As the VVC 
       uses a BFM to handle the actual interface/protocol, this means that in 10% of the BFM transmit calls the VVC will request a 
       parity error to be injected.

Error injection in BFMs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to simplify the specification of which errors to inject, the complete error injection specification is given as a 
sub-record inside the BFM configuration. E.g. inside the UART BFM configuration the following sub-record is defined - with fields 
specifying the error injection details (details given in :ref:`UART BFM <vip_uart_bfm>`).

    * error_injection (fixed name, but type will differ)
        * parity_bit_error (boolean)
        * stop_bit_error (boolean)

In order to initiate error injection, the BFM config record must be modified and included in the BFM procedure call.

Error injection in VVCs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to simplify the specification of which errors to inject, the complete error injection specification is given as a 
sub-record inside the VVC configuration (Note: not the BFM config). E.g. inside the UART VVC configuration the following 
sub-record is defined - with fields specifying the error injection details (Details given in :ref:`UART VVC <vip_uart_vvc>`).

    * error_injection
        * parity_bit_error_prob (real between 0.0 and 1.0)
        * stop_bit_error_prob (real between 0.0 and 1.0)

In order to initiate error injection, the VVC config record must be assigned the wanted values via the VVC configuration shared 
variable (see :ref:`vvc_framework_status_config_transaction_info`).

.. note::

    The Error injection sub-record inside the VVC configuration will override that of the BFM configuration. Any compound or more 
    advanced transactions may of course also request error injection directly or indirectly via the VVC command itself.

Naming and type usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The error injection sub-record will be VVC and BFM dedicated, and thus any names and types may be used, and even sub-records under 
'error_injection' is required. The VVC and BFM error injection records may differ or be the same. The only requirement is that 
readability is prioritised. Values should be checked against legal ranges or values.

Built-in randomization
==================================================================================================================================
UVVM provides functions and procedures for simple generation of random numbers (real, integer, time) and vectors, described in 
:ref:`basic_randomization`. It also provides a more complete randomization package using protected types, which is described in 
:ref:`rand_pkg_overview`. And a more advanced randomization without replacement, described in :ref:`optimized_randomization`.

.. note::

    Only some VVCs currently include built-in randomization (e.g. UART TX VVC and SBI VVC.) The principles shown for these VVCs 
    may be applied directly also for a user defined VIP.

UVVM VIP randomization principles
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Randomization may of course be applied with no limitations in a UVVM based testbench. For UVVM VIP however, we recommend the same 
general approach as for error injection randomizations:

    #. No randomization of data inside BFMs as this would affect the DUT behaviour or output (and a monitor would be required to 
       check the actual DUT stimuli). Hence BFM procedures should only be called with explicit data.
    #. It is recommended that more advanced VVCs include functionality for randomization of data - in order to distribute this 
       away from the test sequencer and increase the re-use value of a VVC. Thus, a VVC may be told to apply random data, in which 
       case the VVC will randomly generate data according to a given profile (e.g. uniform) and provide that data to the interface 
       via the BFM call. The profile and constraints will depend on the needs and the VVC implementation

Data randomization in BFMs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no data randomization inside a normal BFM, for the reason given above.

Data randomization in VVCs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A VVC may be commanded to generate constrained random data, where data in this sense could also be addresses, lengths, etc. 
Typically such commands would allow flexibility for the number of accesses and other important aspects - like scoreboards, common 
buffers, files, etc. A few randomization profiles have been predefined both as typical use cases and as examples for future 
extensions, when needed. The profile names are defined in the type **t_randomisation**, which is declared in the adaptations_pkg.vhd 
to allow users to add more profiles.

+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NA                         | Not applicable (To be used in a record where the field is present, but no randomization wanted)   |
+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| RANDOM                     | Uniform distribution                                                                              |
+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| RANDOM_FAVOUR_EDGES        | | Significantly more edge cases, where "edge" differs between various interfaces.                 |
|                            | | E.g. UART: Cover patterns like 01111111, 00000000, 11111111, 11111110, 01010101, 10101010.      |

Testbench Data Routing
==================================================================================================================================
Transaction Info is providing a mechanism for passively routing source data (data entered into the DUT) out of the VVCs to other 
parts of the testbench. This data routing is passive in the sense that the transaction data is just provided as a shared variable 
- for anyone to read. This is covered in :ref:`vvc_framework_transaction_info`. There is however also a need for routing data 
actively inside the testbench, where routing means fetching from or sending to predefined sources and destinations.

To/from Buffer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UVVM has a global buffer that is divided into multiple smaller buffers that may be indexed and accessed from anywhere in the 
testbench. This functionality is described in :ref:`uvvm_fifo_collection`. VVC commands requesting sourcing data from or sending 
data to these buffers use parameter TO_BUFFER or FROM_BUFFER, followed by the buffer index.

To Scoreboard
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scoreboards may be used anywhere inside the testbench, but for UVVM the following is recommended:

    #. Use Scoreboards only on the destination side of the testbench, i.e. where data is received or fetched out of the DUT.
       E.g. for a UART on the DUT UART TX side (= UART_VVC RX side).
    #. Every VVC may be connected to one single Scoreboard.
    #. The Scoreboard instance number should be the same as the VVC instance number.
    #. When using VVCs, make sure the VVC passes the received data to its Scoreboard, do not check the data in the VVC. E.g. for a 
       UART_VVC, use the receive-command (and not the expect-command) to forward received data to the Scoreboard.

VVC commands requesting sending data to the Scoreboard use parameter TO_SB.

Data routing options
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The profile names are defined in the type :ref:`t_data_routing`, which is defined in types_pkg.vhd

Controlling Property Checkers
==================================================================================================================================
A major VVC advantage is that lots of very useful additional functionality may be added inside the VVC entity, meaning that all 
the verification support for a given interface can be encapsulated inside a single VHDL entity. A major advantage of UVVM is that 
adding additional functionality and controlling it from the test sequencers is really simple.

One very useful additional functionality is property checkers, and some typical examples of this could be to check the minimum 
allowed bit period, the minimum inter-packet gap, back-to-back restrictions, etc., or in general to check a given requirement 
continuously - especially when this is easier to do outside the BFM - for instance in a dedicated checker process.

A dedicated checker process would typically just wait for a trigger condition on the interface (like a UART data bit changing its 
level), then wait again for a next trigger (the next data bit), and then check that the time between the two changes is not less 
than the minimum allowed bit period. This check could then be repeated forever. It is however recommended that the check could be 
turned on and off for more flexibility.

Property check configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In UVVM, turning checkers on and off is controlled by the VVC configuration (see :ref:`vvc_framework_status_config_transaction_info`), 
and often additional control of the checker behaviour is also required. Thus, it is recommended to include the checker control for 
each individual check in a dedicated sub-record. An example on this (for the UART VVC) is shown below. See :ref:`UART VVC 
<vip_uart_vvc>` for implementation. ::

    .bit_rate_checker              -- Sub-record containing all control of the property checker behaviour
        .enable      boolean       -- Enables or disables the complete bit rate checker
        .min_period  time
        .alert_level t_alert_level

For this example, the bit rate checker inside the UART_VVC RX will trigger on changes on the DUT TX and execute the check if 
enable is TRUE.

Setting up the configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bit rate checker configuration may be changed directly from the sequencer via the shared variable VVC configuration.

.. _vvc_framework_vvc_parameters_and_sequence:

VVC Parameters and Sequence for Randomization, Sources and Destinations
==================================================================================================================================
In order to assure a common syntax and understanding for the various VVC commands controlling these features, the sequence and 
type of parameters have been defined as follows:

+--------------------+-------------------------------+---------------+---------------------+-------------------+----------------------+
| Parameter sequence | Preceding command part        | [Repetitions] | Randomness          | Data routing type | [Data routing index] |
+====================+===============================+===============+=====================+===================+======================+
| Example A          | uart_transmit(UART_VVCT,1,TX) | 4             | RANDOM_FAVOUR_EDGES | TO_BUFFER         | 5                    |
+--------------------+-------------------------------+---------------+---------------------+-------------------+----------------------+
| Example B          | uart_receive(UART_VVCT,1,RX)  |               |                     | TO_SB             |                      |
+--------------------+-------------------------------+---------------+---------------------+-------------------+----------------------+

Example A means: make 4 transactions with random data (using predefined profile RANDOM_FAVOUR_EDGES) and send the data also to 
BUFFER 5, e.g. ::

    uart_transmit(UART_VVCT,1,TX, 4, RANDOM_FAVOUR_EDGES, TO_BUFFER, C_UART_BUFFER, "my message");

Example B means: keep on receiving data and send the received data also to the local Scoreboard, e.g. ::

    uart_receive(UART_VVCT,1,RX, 4, TO_SB, "my message");

Exactly what variants will be available for each VVC is up to the VVC designer, but this gives the sequence and the options.

Multiple Central Sequencers
==================================================================================================================================
A structured test environment is important, and we recommend the use of a structured test harness to instantiate VVCs, DUT, clock 
generator and so forth. The testbench may consist of one or more test sequencers which are used to control the complete testbench 
architecture with any number of VVCs, although for a better testbench overview we recommend having a single central test sequencer 
only - for most testbenches.

Monitors
==================================================================================================================================
Monitors could be great to check the interface accesses to a DUT - to report the transaction to the testbench - with all relevant 
info like operation (write, read, transmit, ...), data, address, etc. This information may be critical in order to understand the 
operation of the DUT and its expected outputs. A monitor is not a protocol checker, but may of course check various properties of 
an interface/protocol. A typical Monitor will however only provide the relevant basic information and leave more advance 
interpretation to other parts of a testbench. For simple protocols like the UART, UVVM also includes basic error checking in the 
Monitor - as this happens at a very low level. For more advanced protocols it would make sense to just pass on the low level info 
to a higher level checker. The reason for making a dedicated monitor rather than leaving that to the testbench model is to achieve 
a better testbench structure and more efficient reuse.

It should however be mentioned that implementing Transaction Info (see :ref:`vvc_framework_transaction_info`) inside a VVC 
significantly reduces the need for a dedicated monitor, as the VVC will then be able to pass the complete transaction information 
on to, for instance, a model inside the Testbench.

Transfer of Monitor information to the testbench
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mechanism for passing the monitor deduced transaction out of the monitor is almost exactly the same as for passing transaction 
info out of a VVC - as described in :ref:`vvc_framework_transaction_info`. The only difference is that the monitor can only 
provide parts of what the VVC can provide.

    * No monitor can provide info about compound transactions.
    * For a split transaction protocol like Avalon - only the sub-transactions could be provided (which could be analysed at the 
      higher level to provide Base transactions).
    * A monitor cannot provide meta data like command index or command message.

As the monitor does not know what to expect at the beginning of a transaction the following field limitations apply:

    * Operation: Can only be known some time after the start of the transaction. Will be set when the type of the transaction is 
      known, e.g. TRANSMIT or RECEIVE for UART (otherwise NO_OPERATION).
    * | Transaction_status: Will be set to FAILED or SUCCEEDED as soon as the result is 100% given. Prior to that - during the 
        transaction: IN_PROGRESS.
      | FAILED/SUCCEEDED will remain for the transaction_display_time given inside the monitor configuration record, or until the 
        next transaction FAILED or SUCCEEDED.

An example of a complete monitor is shown in the UART VIP directory.

Transaction info transfer signals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Transaction info provided out of a Monitor uses a set of a global signal and a shared variable. These and all related VHDL 
types are defined in transaction_pkg.

    * **Monitor trigger signal** : *global_<protocol-name>_monitor_transaction_trigger*, e.g. global_uart_monitor_transaction_trigger(channel, instance number)
    * **Monitor shared variable** : *shared_<protocol-name>_monitor_transaction_info*, e.g. shared_uart_monitor_transaction_info(channel, instance number)

See :ref:`vvc_framework_transaction_info_record` Table 5 for more details.

.. _vvc_framework_compile_scripts:

Compile Scripts
==================================================================================================================================
In the script folder in the root directory the *compile_all.do* compiles all UVVM components. This script may be called with one 
to three input arguments:

    * The first input argument is the directory of the script folder at the root directory from the working directory.
    * The second input argument is the target directory of the compiled libraries, by default every library is compiled in a sim 
      folder in the corresponding components directory.
    * The third input argument is the directory to a custom component list in .txt format. The script will only compile the 
      components listed in that file. By default, the script uses the file component_list.txt located in uvvm/script. This file 
      can be modified so that only some components are compiled.

.. code-block:: console

    Example: do uvvm/script/compile_all.do uvvm/script

There are also compile scripts for all UVVM components located in the script folder of each UVVM component. These scripts can be 
called with two input arguments:

    * The first input argument is the directory of the component folder from the working directory.
    * The second input argument is the target directory of the compiled library, default is the sim folder in the respective 
      component.

Scope of Verbosity Control
==================================================================================================================================
| Message IDs are used for verbosity control in many of the procedures and functions in UVVM, as well as log messages and checks 
  in VVCs, BFMs and Scoreboards.
| Note that VVCs and Scoreboards come with dedicated message ID panels and are not affected by the global message ID panel, but 
  accessed by addressing the targeting VVC or Scoreboard and, if applicable, instance number or with a broadcast.
| Also note that when a VVC is executing commands triggered by an HVVC (Hierarchical-VVC), e.g. SBI write due to Ethernet transmit, 
  the VVC will use the HVVC's message ID panel instead. See :ref:`vvc_frameworks_hierarchical_vvcs` for an example of the HVVC 
  structure.

.. code-block::

    -- Global message ID panel. Does not apply to VVCs or Scoreboards, as they have their own local message ID panel

The predefined message IDs are listed in :ref:`message_ids`.

.. _vvc_frameworks_hierarchical_vvcs:

Hierarchical VVCs
==================================================================================================================================
Many protocols and applications consist of several abstraction levels, e.g. physical layer, link layer, transaction layer, etc. 
When writing a test case for a higher level you most likely want to ignore the underlying levels and only deal with the scope of 
the relevant level. The test case will be less complex and easier to both write and read. A hierarchical VVC (HVVC) is a VVC of a 
higher protocol level than the physical layer, i.e. it has no physical connections. The test case only communicates with the HVVC 
which communicate with the lower level. Data is propagated upwards and downwards between the HVVC and DUT through a standard VVC 
connected to the DUT.

The HVVC-to-VVC Bridge is the connection between a hierarchical VVC (HVVC) and the VVC at a lower protocol level, in this context 
referred to only as the VVC. Communications between the HVVC and VVC is handled by the HVVC-to-VVC Bridge. Data is transferred 
between the HVVC and HVVC-to-VVC Bridge on a common interface and converted in the HVVC-to-VVC Bridge to/from the specific 
interface of the VVC used. An example of this concept used on Ethernet is seen in Figure 8.

HVVC usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To simulate an HVVC you only need to do the following:

    #. Instantiate the HVVC in the test harness and set the generic GC_PHY_INTERFACE to the physical interface you want to use.
    #. Instantiate the VVC of the physical interface with the same instance index as GC_PHY_VVC_INSTANCE_IDX.
    #. Connect the VVC of the physical interface to the DUT.

.. code-block::

    i1_ethernet_vvc : entity bitvis_vip_ethernet.ethernet_vvc
      generic map(
        GC_INSTANCE_IDX         => C_VVC_ETH,
        GC_PHY_INTERFACE        => GMII,
        GC_PHY_VVC_INSTANCE_IDX => C_VVC_GMII
    );

    i1_gmii_vvc : entity bitvis_vip_gmii.gmii_vvc
      generic map (
        GC_INSTANCE_IDX  => C_VVC_GMII
      )
      port map (
        gmii_vvc_tx_if => gmii_vvc_tx_if,
        gmii_vvc_rx_if => gmii_vvc_rx_if
    );

Any VVC can be used as a physical interface, however it needs to have an HVVC-to-VVC Bridge implementation. You can find the 
available implementations under *bitvis_vip_hvvc_to_vvc_bridge/src*.

For information on how to implement your own, see :ref:`vip_hvvc_to_vvc_bridge`.

VVC Implementation Guide
**********************************************************************************************************************************
.. important::

    * This guide is meant for users that want to make their own VVC.
    * Users that only write test cases that are using the VVCs do **NOT** need to read this guide.

Making test cases using available VVCs is very easy. Implementing new VVCs is slightly more complex, but fast, safe and efficient 
once you understand the VVC mechanisms.

* This guide goes through all relevant files needed to make a complete VVC.
* The intention is to allow a VVC implementer to go through file by file and understand and modify as needed.
* All code objects and functionality given in the VVC and UVVM files are considered mandatory unless otherwise noted.

Prerequisites
==================================================================================================================================

    #. Go through `The critically missing VHDL testbench feature - Finally a structured approach - A brief introduction 
       <https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/tree/master/uvvm_vvc_framework/doc/The_critically_missing_VHDL_TB_feature.ppsx>`_ - for a 
       presentation on cycle related corner cases and the need for a far more structured verification approach, and to understand 
       the basic concepts, the communication and handshake between the central sequencer and the VVCs.
    #. If your VVC is going to access a DUT interface, you need to have a BFM (Bus Functional Model) for that interface - 
       independent of whether you are going to make a VVC.

Implementing your new VVC
==================================================================================================================================

    #. Use the script vvc_generator located in the *uvvm_vvc_framework/script/vvc_generator/* to generate a new VVC. Notice that 
       the name length is limited by C_LOG_SCOPE_WIDTH (default =20) in *uvvm_util/src/adaptations_pkg.vhd*
    #. Then see comments in the code for where to make required changes.
    #. If the new VVC uses multiple channels other than TX and RX, modify the t_channel type under *uvvm_util/src/adaptations_pkg.vhd*
    #. See this guide for an explanation to all the various sections you need to evaluate or modify - file by file.

Dependent and independent source
==================================================================================================================================
One of the key concepts of the UVVM VVC Framework is the compilation strategy, and how some packages in the UVVM VVC Framework 
directory are compiled into each of the individual VVC libraries. To avoid confusion about this for future VVC designers, the VVC 
dependent and VVC independent sources have been marked and split into two source directories:

    #. The target dependent source, also known as packages that are compiled into each of the individual VVCs, are placed in the 
       *src_target_dependent/* folder. These files are also prefixed with "td_*" for "target dependent".
    #. The target independent files are compiled into the uvvm_vvc_framework library. These files are placed in the *src/* folder 
       and prefixed with "ti_*" for "target independent".

For examples of how the compile order should be handled, please see the example VIPs' documentation and compile scripts.

<name>_vvc.vhd
==================================================================================================================================

For single channel VVCs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entity
^^^^^^
================= ================================================================================================================
GC_INSTANCE_IDX   Needed in case there are multiple instances of a given VVC. (E.g. DUT with 2 <VVC-NAME>S). Default is 1, but any 
                  natural type is ok.
GC_<name>_CONFIG  Recommended. Allows predefined BFM behaviour to be set up for every VVC.
GC_CMD_QUEUE_*    Needed to limit the queue size and to generate a warning if more elements in the queue than ever expected.
Other generics    Optional and VVC dependent. These generics could for example contain widths of BFM signals.
================= ================================================================================================================

The interface to the DUT and any other needed I/O. The examples show DUT interfaces as single signals, records and records of 
records. This is optional.

Declarations
^^^^^^^^^^^^
================= ================================================================================================================
C_SCOPE           Used for logs and alerts. C_VVC_NAME is defined in the VVC `vvc_methods_pkg.vhd`
C_VVC_LABELS      A record of constants, e.g. name and channel, used in multiple procedures.
================= ================================================================================================================

* Various status signals used as flags between the processes.
* Command termination record. (Fields: set, reset, is_active). Where set and reset signal fields are used to toggle is_active. 
  Used as inter process flags.
* command_queue is the queue of commands to be executed in sequence towards the DUT.
* The aliases are defined to allow common and simplified names.

Constructor
^^^^^^^^^^^
The constructor is run once only - immediately when starting the simulation. The procedure:

    * Initialises VVC with BFM config and the queue with queue name.
    * Allows constructor log for VVC info (using ID_CONSTRUCTOR), and VVC Queue info (using ID_CONSTRUCTOR_SUB).

The procedure will report alerts with severity TB_FAILURE if one of the following occurs:

    * The instantiated VVC index is higher or equal to the maximum allowed number of VVC instances, given by C_MAX_VVC_INSTANCE_NUM 
      in *uvvm_util/src/adaptations_pkg.vhd*
    * UVVM has not been initialized.

Command Interpreter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Waits for commands from the central test sequencer distributed to this VVC, then puts the command on the queue for execution or 
immediately performs the required action - depending on command type. Afterwards, it acknowledges the command and waits for the 
next command from the sequencer.

| Step 0
| ``initialize_interpreter()``
|   - Initialises parameters to default passive/initial values (e.g. terminate_current_cmd.set := '0').

| Step 1
| ``await_cmd_from_sequencer()``
|   - Waits for a command from the central sequencer. Continues on matching VVC, instance index, name and channel.
|   - Log at start using ID_CMD_INTERPRETER_WAIT and at the end using ID_CMD_INTERPRETER.
|   - Will only accept exact matches of instance index and name, and either the correct address or "ALL_CHANNELS".

| Step 2a (Only if command type is QUEUED)
| ``put_command_on_queue()``
|   - Puts the received command on the VVC queue (for later retrieval by the Command Executor).

| Step 2b (Only if command type is IMMEDIATE)
| Execute the requested command/operation.
|   - For the VVC methods these procedures will correspond to the UVVM methods, but prepended with "interpreter\_", e.g. 
      "interpreter_await_completion()". These UVVM methods are documented in :ref:`vvc_framework_methods`. Other commands are 
      documented in their respective VIPs.
|   - format_commmand_idx(): (ti_vvc_framework_support_pkg) Converts the command index to string, enclosed by C_CMD_IDX_PREFIX and 
      C_CMD_IDX_SUFFIX (found in *uvvm_util/src/adaptations_pkg.vhd*).

| Step 3
| ``acknowledge_cmd()``
|   - Acknowledges the command from the sequencer by driving the *global_vvc_ack* signal to '1' for 1 delta cycle, then setting it 
      back to 'Z'. This lets the central sequencer know that it can continue execution.

Command Executor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fetches commands from the command queue - if any. Then executes the command and fetches or waits for the next command in the 
command queue.

| Step 0
| ``initialize_executor()``
|   - Initialises parameters to default passive/initial values (e.g. terminate_current_cmd.reset := '0').

| Step 1
| ``fetch_command_and_prepare_executor()``
|   - Fetches a command from the queue (waits until available if needed).
|   - Sets relevant flag parameters.
|   - Log command using ID_CMD_EXECUTOR (or log using ID_CMD_EXECUTOR_WAIT if queue is empty).
| Set transaction information for wave-view.
|   - *transaction_info_for_waveview* (from vvc_methods_pkg.vhd) is a shared variable intended for use in a wave-view - to yield a 
      better overview of transaction info. Setting this information is optional. The pad_string() and to_string() procedures are 
      documented in :ref:`util_string_handling`.
| Insert inter-BFM delay if requested.
|   - ``insert_inter_bfm_delay_if_requested()`` Inserts either start-to-start or finish-to-start delay between BFM accesses if 
      this is set in the *inter_bfm_delay* parameter in 'vvc_config'. Logs information using ID_CMD_EXECUTOR.
|   - If the command currently being processed by the executor is a BFM access, a timestamp will be stored in 
      *v_timestamp_start_of_current_bfm_access*.

| Step 2
| Executes a command depending on the requested command/operation.
|   - *terminate_current_cmd* is only checked inside operations that require multiple BFM accesses - like for instance a POLL_UNTIL 
      command.
|   - ``store_result()`` is executed for any BFM, where it makes sense for you to store the result of a BFM access. In our example 
      for SBI we think it only makes sense for 'READ'.
|   - Logging as defined by your BFM.
|   - Transaction info can be stored in the *transaction_info_for_waveview* struct for each command type, but this is optional.
| Update the BFM access timestamps if this was a BFM access.
|   - *v_timestamp_of_last_bfm_access* is set to 'now'.
|   - *v_timestamp_start_of_last_bfm_access* is set to *v_timestamp_start_of_current_bfm_access*.
| The *terminate_current_cmd* flag is reset if it has been active.
| Update the *last_cmd_idx_executed* variable with the current command index (*v_cmd.cmd_idx*).

Command Terminator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The command terminator concurrent procedure sets the *is_active* flag based on the set and reset flags.

Additional for multi-channel VVCs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that we strongly recommend implementing the VVCs such that each leaf VVC handles one independent DUT communication 
thread (here: 'channel'). No more; no less. This allows a single command queue and a single executor handling DUT communication. 
(Additional processes to handle other characteristics is fine. E.g., a parallel bit-rate check thread).

Note that SBI_VVC must handle both read and write accesses, but never simultaneously and always in the given order.

Multi-channel VVCs may be implemented in many different ways - depending on your preferences and priorities. The included
bitvis_vip_uart implementation uses the following method:

    *  | **A unique VVC implementation with GC_CHANNEL generic input**
       | This approach uses unique VVC implementations for each channel, e.g. in uart_rx_vvc.vhd and uart_tx_vvc.vhd, but they 
         both share the VVC target parameter, UART_VVCT. They both use the GC_CHANNEL generic input to specify their channel, i.e. 
         TX or RX. The VVCs have restrictions that ensure that e.g. the UART TX VVC can't use the UART RX BFM procedures.
         Using this UART VVC would look like:
       |    a. uart_transmit(UART_VVCT, TX, 1, ...)
       |    b. uart_receive(UART_VVCT, RX, 1, ...)

When using multiple leaf VVCs it is recommended to use a wrapper architecture to encapsulate the channels. This way, it is 
possible to instantiate a single VVC rather than each VVC channel individually. For more information about the wrapper architecture, 
see the uart_vvc.vhd example in the bitvis_vip_uart/src/ directory.

vvc_cmd_pkg.vhd
==================================================================================================================================

t_operation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contains all UVVM common operations, e.g. AWAIT_COMPLETION and ENABLE_LOG_MSG, in addition to the VVC specific operations such as 
e.g. WRITE and READ. The VVC specific will have to be evaluated and potentially replaced when implementing a new VVC. The 
t_operation type is used when relaying commands from the sequencer to the VVC. The t_operation type also has its own to_string() 
function in this package.

t_vvc_cmd_record
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record type used for relaying a command from the testbench sequencer to the VVC. The record contains fields needed in the common 
UVVM procedures (listed under the "Common UVVM fields" comment), and VVC specific fields needed to relay data to the VVC executor. 
The VVC specific data fields should contain any data fields that the BFM procedures might need, e.g. data, address, timeouts etc. 
There is also a default for this type called C_VVC_CMD_DEFAULT in this package.

Constants
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vvc_cmd_pkg.vhd should contain constants that needs to be set for the entire VVC. In most VVCs this will include the 
C_VVC_CMD_STRING_MAX_LENGTH which determines the maximum size of msg variables in the VVC. It is also a good idea to declare 
constants for maximum VVC data/address bus sizes here. It will be possible to construct VVCs with bus sizes up to and including 
the sizes declared here.

Shared Variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The shared_vvc_cmd shared variable (type t_vvc_cmd_record) is used for relaying commands between sequencer methods and the VVC. It 
is default set to C_VVC_CMD_DEFAULT, which is also declared in this file.

vvc_methods_pkg.vhd
==================================================================================================================================

Constants and aliases
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vvc_methods_pkg contains constants for the VVC name, e.g. "<NAME>_VVC". There are also aliases created to make the code more 
readable.

<NAME>_VVCT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The <NAME>_VVCT signal (e.g. SBI_VVCT) is the VVC target record signal. The target type **t_vvc_target_record** is a record that 
contains the parameters needed to trigger a VVC, and to identify the correct target of a VVC command.

t_vvc_config
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This type contains the needed configuration for setting up the VVC and BFM. In Bitvis VVCs the BFM configuration is encapsulated 
in a bfm_config record, of type **t_<bfm_name>_bfm_config**. This record is placed in this file and compiled into each VVC since 
the VVC/BFM configuration will differ for each VVC. The record contents are:

    * inter_bfm_delay: A record containing the potential inter-bfm delay specifications, e.g. if BFM accesses shall be separated 
      with a given time.
    * cmd_queue_count_*: Command queue specifications.
    * msg_id_panel: The ID panel that the VVC shall use.
    * bfm_config: A record containing all settings for the BFM, e.g. clock periods, message IDs etc.

| A constant C_<name>_VVC_CONFIG_DEFAULT is defined for this type to use as default value.
| A shared variable array of t_vvc_config *shared_<name>_vvc_config* is declared and all elements are set to the default value.

t_vvc_status
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The optional status record is created in order for the testbench sequencer to have access to the status of the VVC. The status 
record can contain anything that is relevant for the outside, and it is recommended to have at least these three fields:

    * current_cmd_idx: The current command index being processed in the executor.
    * previous_cmd_idx: The previous command index being processed in the executor.
    * pending_cmd_idx: The number of pending commands to be processed by the executor.

| A constant C_VVC_STATUS_DEFAULT is defined for this type to use as default value.
| A shared variable array of t_vvc_status *shared_<name>_vvc_status* is declared and all elements are set to the default value.

t_transaction_info_for_waveview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The t_transaction_info_for_waveview type is an optional status record to be used in the wave-view. This record should be modified 
to suit the BFM fields, but it can also contain the VVC field t_operation, which can be updated with the VVC operation currently 
being processed by the executor. The transaction_info_for_waveview is meant as a way of improving the readability of wave-views.

| A constant C_TRANSACTION_INFO_FOR_WAVEVIEW_DEFAULT is defined for this type to use as default value.
| A shared variable of t_transaction_info_for_waveview *t_<name>_transaction_info_for_waveview* is declared and all elements are set 
  to the default value.

VVC Dedicated Methods
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vvc_methods_pkg.vhd file also contains the VVC procedures that are called from the testbench sequencer. These procedures 
should reflect the procedures in the BFM, e.g. <name>_write or <name>_receive. The parameters of these procedures are mostly up to 
the user, but it is recommended that the BFM arguments that are rarely altered be placed into the bfm_config parameter, while the 
parameters that changes often are used as input arguments.

Since these VVC methods are reused for all instances of this VVC, it is necessary with some extra parameters in order to specify 
which VVC instance to forward the call to. This is done with the first two (or three) parameters::

    signal   VVCT             : inout t_vvc_target_record;
    constant vvc_instance_idx : in    integer;
    constant channel          : in    t_channel;           -- Only if the VVC is multi-channel.

The method bodies are quite similar for all VVC commands:

    #. First, the shared_vvc_cmd record is set to its default value, resetting the data from any potential previous command.
    #. The general VVC fields (e.g. name and instance index) are set using the UVVM method set_general_target_and_command_fields().
    #. The VVC specific fields are set in the *shared_vvc_cmd* shared variable. This means e.g. address and data fields.
    #. The command is sent to all VVCs using the UVVM method send_command_to_vvc(VVCT).

All VVC instances and channels of this type receive the command, but only the VVC with the correct instance index, channel and 
name will accept it and acknowledge it.

vvc_context.vhd
==================================================================================================================================
This file contains all the necessary packages that are used when simulating a VVC. When adding a VVC to a testbench, the user only 
needs to add the following lines in the header::

    library bitvis_vip_<name>;
    context bitvis_vip_<name>.vvc_context;

The generated file from the vvc_generator script has the following as default:

    * transaction_pkg.all
    * vvc_methods_pkg.all
    * td_vvc_framework_common_methods_pkg.all
    * <name>_bfm_pkg.t_<name>_if --> BFM interface type (remove if not used)
    * <name>_bfm_pkg.t_<name>_bfm_config --> BFM configuration type
    * <name>_bfm_pkg.C_<name>_CONFIG_DEFAULT --> BFM default configuration constant

Additional types or constants can be added if needed.

BFM prerequisites
==================================================================================================================================
There are no firm restrictions of how to implement the BFM in order for the VVC to function, but if the VVC generated with the 
vvc_generator script is to work out of the box, it is necessary to have some components in the BFM:

    * The BFM needs to be called <name>_bfm_pkg.vhd. If this is not the case, the package use clauses in each of the VVC files 
      needs to be altered.
    * The BFM needs to contain a bfm_config record type with an associated default constant. The generated VVC file assumes that 
      this bfm config type is called **t_<name>_bfm_config** and the constant is called C_<NAME>_BFM_CONFIG_DEFAULT. In order to 
      support the delay operation in the VVC executor the BFM config type will also need to have a parameter clock_period. If this 
      is not needed, the "INSERT_DELAY" case in the generated VVC can be removed.

A BFM skeleton that contains the necessary structure is created by the vvc_generator script, and can be used as a base for a BFM 
that includes the necessary structure for the VVC to work out of the box.

UVVM Framework Packages
==================================================================================================================================

td_target_support_pkg.vhd
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The UVVM VVC dedicated support package contains VVC support that is common for all VVCs, but needs to be compiled specifically 
into each of the VVC libraries.

Target record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The target record type **t_vvc_target_record** is used to target a VVC command to a specific VVC implementation. This is needed 
since many of the UVVM common commands are shared between all VVCs, e.g. await_completion() which is compiled into each VVC library.

For a sequencer with two VVCs, A and B, there must be a way of determining if await_completion is to be executed in VVC A or VVC B. 
To resolve this, each VVC has a signal in their vvc_methods_pkg.vhd that is compiled into their own library. For VVC A and B this 
signal will be called A_VVCT and B_VVCT. When await_completion(A_VVCT,...) is called from the sequencer, the compiler will 
understand that this await_completion is called with target type library_a.t_vvc_target_record, which only complies with the 
await_completion procedure in the VVC A library.

The td_target_support_pkg.vhd also contains a default value for the **t_vvc_target_record** type, and a function 
set_vvc_target_defaults() for setting the VVC target based on the VVC name.

String methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The package contains two string methods:

    * to_string(): This function converts a t_vvc_target_record, vvc_instance and vvc_channel into a string.
    * format_command_idx(): Function which encapsulates a command record index.

send_command_to_vvc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sends command to VVC and waits for ACK or timeout.

    * Logs with ID_UVVM_SEND_CMD when sending to VVC.
    * Logs with ID_UVVM_CMD_ACK when ACK or timeout occurs.

Setting the command field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sets target index and channel, and updates *shared_vvc_cmd* which is used to transport VVC commands from the central testbench 
sequencer to VVC.

td_vvc_entity_support_pkg.vhd
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The VVC support package contains procedures that are compiled into and used in the VVC. This includes initializers for the executor 
and interpreter, and the interpreter procedures called interpreter_*, e.g. interpreter_await_completion(). For more information 
about the interpreter_* procedures, please see :ref:`vvc_framework_methods`. For more information about the other methods in this 
package, see :ref:`vvc_framework_name_vvc`. In addition to the procedures, the td_vvc_entity_support_pkg.vhd also contains types 
for VVC labels and executor results. The result array is also defined and its shared variable is instantiated in this package.
