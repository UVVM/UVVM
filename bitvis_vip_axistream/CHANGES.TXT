Bitvis VIP axistream (AXI4-Stream) - Overview on Versions and Changes
==============================================================

v4.2.0
----------
Released: 2019-09-02
- Fixed bug in BFM receive procedure where it could receive more bytes
  than expected in the last word.
- Allowed non-normalized data arrays to be used in the transmit, receive
  and expect VVC & BFM procedures.
- Fixed deassertion of tready signal when config ready_default_value=1.
- Avoid executing commands in the VVC when GC_VVC_IS_MASTER is wrongly configured.
- Made BFM receive procedure always timeout at max_wait_cycles.
- BFM receive procedure now samples the data at the rising edge of the clock.
- Fixed tready signal being asserted before tvalid was asserted when using
  config ready_default_value=0.
- Changed back to using the record BFM calls from the VVC as the bug from Questa
  has been fixed.
- Added a feature to deassert tvalid once or multiple random times from the master
  using the config record.
- Added a feature to deassert tready multiple random times from the slave using
  the config record.
- Fixed VVC receive procedure returning the data at the end of the byte_array
  when config byte_endianness was FIRST_BYTE_RIGHT.
- Updated documentation.

----------
Released: 2017-03-16
- Updated documentation
- Added support for TDEST, TID, TSTRB.
  - Required changes by user :
    - When declaring the axistream interface signal, these new signals must be contrained, for example:

        signal axistream_if_m : t_axistream_if(tdata(GC_DATA_WIDTH -1 downto 0),
                                               tkeep((GC_DATA_WIDTH/8)-1 downto 0),
                                               tuser(GC_USER_WIDTH -1 downto 0),
                                               tstrb(GC_STRB_WIDTH-1 downto 0),   -- new!
                                               tid  (GC_TID_WIDTH-1 downto 0),    -- new!
                                               tdest(C_TDEST_WIDTH-1 downto 0)    -- new!
                                              );

    - Calls to init_axistream_if_signals() must be updated, if any.

----------
Released: 2017-02-01

v2.0.1
----------
