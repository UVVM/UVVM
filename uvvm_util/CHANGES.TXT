- Add ID_INSERTED_DELAY to adaptations_pkg.vhd


v1.3.2
----------
Released: 2016-10-28

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- Corrected radix logging in check_value method
- Minor bugfixes


v1.3.1
----------
Released: 2016-08-30

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- Bug fix in procedure check_value() for std_logic: Changed match strictness
  from MATCH_EXACT to MATCH_STD to make it equal to function check_value()
  for std_logic and equal to what is documented in the Quickref.

v1.3.0
----------
Released: 2016-05-02

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- Improved method of setting log line width by adding the subfield widths
- Added new constant C_LOG_LINE_SPACINGS that clearly shows what part of the
  message is used for spaces
- Show log id/scope is now set by a constant (was global signal), and the
  total log line width is checked during initialization.
- Removed OSVVM default log msg id panel C_OSVVM_DEFAULT_MSG_ID_PANEL. 
  Using C_MSG_ID_PANEL_DEFAULT instead.
- clock_generator: Removed a printout that indicated that the clock was 
  stopped at time 0. Clock was not started previous to the message.
- Added new msg ids ID_BFM_POLL_SUMMARY and ID_UVVM_DATA_QUEUE
- to_string for string type: Now ignores LF character. Log and alert procedures
  call to_string on msg and scope inputs.
- to_string for t_byte_array: radix parameter now optional
- An alert with severity TB_WARNING is now triggered if attempting
  to enable msg id ID_NEVER
- set_alert_file_name/set_log_file name: msg id parameter was not
  in use. Removed the parameter from Quick-reference and added an
  overload that does not have msg id as a parameter
- Quickref: gen_pulse was missing mandatory msg parameter on front page


v1.2.0
----------
Released: 2016-03-16

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- Added uvvm_osvvm
- Added optional output signal clock_count to clock generators.
- Added new type t_byte_array and a to_string overload for this type.
- Added new overload of disable_log_msg that does not require a msg parameter
- Added quietness parameter to enable_log_msg.
- Added a new shared variable to adaptations_pkg, shared_default_log_destination,
  that sets the default log destination. Procedure set_log_destination() can be
  used to set this parameter in run-time.
- QuickRef:
  - Added more information on how to use Message IDs in section 1.9

v1.1.2
----------
Released: 2016-01-20

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- License conditions have changed. UVVM Utility Library is now released 
  under the MIT license, see LICENSE.txt
- Added ability to set duty cycle in clock_generator() procedures,
  either by percentage or time.
- Clock generators: Variable v_first_half_clk_period is now constant
  C_FIRST_HALF_CLK_PERIOD since it shall not change in the procedures.
- Removed redundant to_string() overloads that are provided by the VHDL-2008
  standard. These overloads were not listed in the Quick Reference as they
  were only meant to be used by UVVM-Util itself. The behaviour of UVVM-Util
  after this change is the same.
- QuickRef:
  - Added examples to all methods.
  - Changed bracket style of optional parameters.
- Added a demo directory that contains a list of demo testbenches that can
  be run to demonstrate the UVVM Utility Library.

v1.1.1
----------
Released: 2015-12-08

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- Added new optional parameter for check_value and await_value for SL/SLV to set if 
  match is exact match (MATCH_EXACT) or std_match (MATCH_STD)
- C_WARNING_ON_LOG_ALERT_FILE_RUNTIME_RENAME is not default false
- Compile order in the QuickRef has been updated
- Description of how BVUL users can start using UVVM-Util has been added to the
  README.txt file
- Added chapter in QuickRef for Hierarchical Alerts

v1.1.0
----------
Released: 2015-11-18

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- Renamed C_CMD_QUEUE_COUNT_ALERT_LEVEL to C_CMD_QUEUE_COUNT_THRESHOLD
- Renamed C_CMD_QUEUE_COUNT_ALERT_LEVEL_SEVERITY to C_CMD_QUEUE_COUNT_THRESHOLD_SEVERITY
- Added t_inter_bfm_delay_type for time delay and clock cycle delay in VVCs
- Added wait_num_rising_edge and wait_num_rising_edge_plus_margin procedures
- Added ALL_CHANNELS to the t_channel type
- Updated QuickRef with new style
- Fixed typo in get_string_between_delimiters function
- It is now possible to set new log/alert output file at runtime
- Added new justify function. Old version will be deprecated in next major release
- Added new to_string for int and bool. Old version will be deprecated in next major release
- Added function pad_string
- Added on/off switch (C_USE_BACKSLASH_R_AS_LF) for \r


v1.0.2
----------
Released: 2015-10-20

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- Updated license printout


v1.0.1
----------
Released: 2015-10-12

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- Renamed constant in adaptations pkg from C_NUMBER_OF_BITS_PER_DATA_BUFFER
  to C_TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_BITS_IN_DATA_BUFFER.

v1.0.0
----------
Released: 2015-10-09

All changes should be backwards compatible within 1.x.x
- First version. Hence no change history for the UVVM Utility Library.
  This library is a continuation and expansion of the Bitvis Utility Library.
  The Bitvis Utility Library is discontinued as of version 2.6.0 (except for bug fixes).
  See the Bitvis Utility Library v2.6.0 for full change history prior to the release of
  UVVM.
  -Important changes since release of the Bitvis Utility Library v2.6.0:
    - Removed support for VHDL93 and VHDL2002
    - Included support for hierarchical alert reporting. Hierarchical alert reporting
      allows for a hierarchy tree to be defined during run-time. The alert summary will
      then be shown as a tree of defined scopes. Alert counters will propagate up the tree 
      to the top level, and stop limits can be set at each level in the hierarchy.
      See the PowerPoint presentation 'UVVM_Utility_Library_Concepts_and_Usage.pps' for 
      more information.
