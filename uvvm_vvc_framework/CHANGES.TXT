- Changed names of the FIFO and Stack procedures to uvvm_* (e.g. uvvm_fifo_init)
- Replaced the procedure 'uvvm_initialize' with a new entity 'ti_uvvm_engine'
  --> Required action by users: in your test harness, replace for example
        i_initialize_uvvm : initialize_uvvm;
      with
        i_ti_uvvm_engine  : entity uvvm_vvc_framework.ti_uvvm_engine;
- Changed vvc_generator script to include range checks
- Changed ID_CMD_EXECUTOR to ID_INSERTED_DELAY in insert_inter_bfm_delay_if_requested method

- Added AWAIT_ANY_COMPLETION.
  --> Required action by users with custom VVCs:
      - in your VVC's vvc_cmd_pkg : - add AWAIT_ANY_COMPLETION to t_operation
                                    - add the following to t_vvc_cmd_record:
                                        gen_integer_array     : t_integer_array(0 to 1); -- Increase array length if needed
                                        gen_boolean           : boolean; -- Generic boolean
                                        timeout               : time;
                                    - add the following to C_VVC_CMD_DEFAULT:
                                        gen_integer_array     => (others => -1),
                                        gen_boolean           => false,
                                        timeout               => 0 ns,
      - in your VVC's *_vvc.vhd : - To actually use the new AWAIT_ANY_COMPLETION feature, multiple changes are required in the cmd_interpreter process.
                                    Use the Bitvis VVCs as examples.

- Added possibility for generic FETCH_RESULT (not just std_logic_vector):
  --> Required action by users with custom VVCs:
      - in your VVC's vvc_cmd_pkg : - add the following definitions:
                                      -- For simple VVCs, which previously only used SLVs the result container can be declared as a type/subtype, e.g. (from SBI):
                                      subtype  t_vvc_result is std_logic_vector(C_VVC_CMD_DATA_MAX_LENGTH-1 downto 0);

                                      -- For more comprehensive return types the t_vvc_result can be declared as a record, e.g. (from AXI-Stream):
                                      type t_vvc_result is record
                                        data_array   : t_byte_array(0 to C_VVC_CMD_DATA_MAX_BYTES-1);
                                        data_length  : natural;
                                        user_array   : t_user_array(0 to C_VVC_CMD_DATA_MAX_WORDS-1);
                                      end record;

                                      type t_vvc_result_queue_element is record
                                        cmd_idx       : natural;   -- from UVVM handshake mechanism
                                        result        : t_vvc_result;
                                      end record;

                                      type t_vvc_response is record
                                        fetch_is_accepted    : boolean;
                                        transaction_result   : t_transaction_result;
                                        result               : t_vvc_result;
                                      end record;

                                      shared variable shared_vvc_response : t_vvc_response;
      - in your VVC's *_vvc.vhd
        - update the call to store_result to the following :
            work.td_vvc_entity_support_pkg.store_result(result_queue => result_queue,
                                                        cmd_idx      => v_cmd.cmd_idx,
                                                        result       => v_result ); -- variable v_result : t_vvc_result:
        - Test benches that uses the std_logic_vector version of fetch_result also requires changes, since the type returned is now t_vvc_result.
            For an example where the VVC needs to be altered when the result type is a subtype of std_logic_vector, please see how the t_vvc_result is used in the sbi_vvc READ command.
            For an example where of how the t_vvc_result is handled when using a more complex return type, please see how the t_vvc_result is used in the axistream_vvc RECEIVE command.

- Removed the use of INSERT_DELAY_IN_TIME. Merged with INSERT_DELAY.
  -- In your VVC's *_vvc.vhd :
     - Replace the following two 'when' statements :
            when INSERT_DELAY =>
              if v_cmd.gen_integer = -1 then
              log(ID_INSERTED_DELAY, "Running: " & to_string(v_cmd.proc_call) & " " & format_command_idx(v_cmd), C_SCOPE, vvc_config.msg_id_panel);
               wait for v_cmd.gen_integer * vvc_config.bfm_config.clock_period;

            when INSERT_DELAY_IN_TIME =>
              log(ID_INSERTED_DELAY, "Running: " & to_string(v_cmd.proc_call) & " " & format_command_idx(v_cmd), C_SCOPE, vvc_config.msg_id_panel);
               wait for v_cmd.delay;

      with the following 'when' statement:
            when INSERT_DELAY =>
              log(ID_INSERTED_DELAY, "Running: " & to_string(v_cmd.proc_call) & " " & format_command_idx(v_cmd), C_SCOPE, vvc_config.msg_id_panel);
              if v_cmd.gen_integer_array(0) = -1 then
                -- Delay specified using time
                wait for v_cmd.delay;
              else
                -- Delay specified using integer
                wait for v_cmd.gen_integer_array(0) * vvc_config.bfm_config.clock_period;
              end if;
- Added Method get_last_received_cmd_idx.
  --> Required action by users:
        If you have for example sbi_read and want to fetch the result of the read method afterwards then you
        must get the id of the read command with e.g. v_cmd_idx := get_last_received_cmd_idx(SBI_VVCT,1);
