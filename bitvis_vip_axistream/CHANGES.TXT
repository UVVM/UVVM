  default -1 ns, i.e. will require user configuration if BFM synchronisation is
  used with other than SYNC_ON_CLOCK_ONLY.
- VVC command insert_delay() will raise a TB_ERROR when called if the 
  bfm_config.clock_period has not been set.  
- Direct Transaction Transfer (DTT) is divided in a global trigger signal and 
  shared variable with transfer related information.

  config ready_default_value=0.

  has been fixed.

  using the config record.

  the config record.
