- Added reference to verbosity control in VVC QR.

v2.6.0
----------
Released: 2020-03-30
- Replaced use_provided_msg_id_panel and msg_id_panel for parent_msg_id_panel in
  vvc_cmd_pkg. Added parent_msg_id_panel optional parameter to all VVC procedures

v2.5.1
----------
Released: 2020-02-16

  exit after a quarter clock period.
- BFM config defaults setup_time, hold_time and clock_period are now 
  default -1 ns, i.e. will require user configuration if BFM synchronisation is
  used with other than SYNC_ON_CLOCK_ONLY.
- VVC command insert_delay() will raise a TB_ERROR when called if the 
  bfm_config.clock_period has not been set.
